# Activate-Games

Authors: Ryan Boch and Liam Aumann

This will be a framework to create Jeopardy and Family Feud games used for youth group. We will need an html/css framework, an admin page to create new jeopardy games, a SQLite database to save new games, and Python code for the backend.

bootstrap is needed to run this code!
